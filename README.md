# OpenKilnHMI

This is an HMI written in VB.NET for the OpenKiln project. It's messy but it gets the job done. OpenKiln actually had a webserver running at one time but that proved to be unreliable so I opted for modbus tcp protocol instead and create this client as well as a client for my node-red server. The node-red server then host a webpage HMI for control.

More details to come later but for now please feel free to ramble around the code.
